# Image_Colorization

Abstract:
  Colorization is a process of converting grayscale images into visually acceptable color images. Automatic conversion has become a challenging area that combines machine learning and deep learning with art. Interfaces which the user can easily access and interact with to color the greyscale images are even rarer. Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. Convolutional Neural Networks in Deep Learning can be used to analyze and color the grayscale images.  CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories. A CNN model built from scratch as well as an autoencoder model and a pretrained model were all trained on the Flickr 8k Image dataset and validated using a 20% validation set. The best model has been chosen and a Python-Flask backend along with a HTML-CSS designed website has been constructed for improved human computer interaction and better access for image colorization.

Note: Download the Flickr 8k dataset and extract all image files into Images folder.

Note: Create a folder models and add the trained weights if needed [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1KI9fCihX3c2DpU_s6XCJGCngpxZeEcOM)
